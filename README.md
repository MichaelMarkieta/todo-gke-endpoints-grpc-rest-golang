# About this repo

This is a proof of concept for a Golang gRPC API server, running in Google Kubernetes Engine, exposed through Cloud Endpoints with HTTP REST annotation, and auto-documented using Swagger UI. You will be able to interact with the API using both gRPC and REST. You will deploy the configuration using Google Container Builder in your own Google Cloud Platform project.
